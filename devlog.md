Devlog:
it looks like i wrote my notes in the readme markdown file instead, woops. I will find a way to put all my previous notes here and then add the rest


2nd project for paradigms class \ 
Must write in SWI Prolog (gotta learn it too) \ 
I think i have enough time to start it earlier than last time (hopefully)
Professor said brute force is probably recommended, Prolog loves tail call optimization,

Costs-
time it takes to getting better at prolog
sanity (finals weeks)

I am going to start the project today instead, because i was preparing for the finals that i have to do (unfortunately) \n
However, despite the project lookin a bit hard i hear from the discord server that the project is relatively easier and faster than the previous project

Ending session (with barely anything)
I didn't work on the project as much since i focused mostly on writing up notes for my finals. Hopefully when finals are done tmrw i can finish up my remaining homework and spend time making the project

I am subject to the procrastination of project making again. Its a good thing that delay happened, so i could work on the homework 6 assignment with a little less stress. I hope to get down most of the base code in here while I work. I am really hoping the class discord server was right about this project being relatively faster than the last one.
