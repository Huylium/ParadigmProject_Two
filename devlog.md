Devlog:
it looks like i wrote my notes in the readme markdown file instead, woops. I will find a way to put all my previous notes here and then add the rest


2nd project for paradigms class \ 
Must write in SWI Prolog (gotta learn it too) \ 
I think i have enough time to start it earlier than last time (hopefully)
Professor said brute force is probably recommended, Prolog loves tail call optimization,

Costs-
time it takes to getting better at prolog
sanity (finals weeks)

I am going to start the project today instead, because i was preparing for the finals that i have to do (unfortunately) \n
However, despite the project lookin a bit hard i hear from the discord server that the project is relatively easier and faster than the previous project

Ending session (with barely anything)
I didn't work on the project as much since i focused mostly on writing up notes for my finals. Hopefully when finals are done tmrw i can finish up my remaining homework and spend time making the project

I am subject to the procrastination of project making again. Its a good thing that delay happened, so i could work on the homework 6 assignment with a little less stress. I hope to get down most of the base code in here while I work. I am really hoping the class discord server was right about this project being relatively faster than the last one.

1:37am (now 12/10/2025)
I currently am working on the first version still as i had to do stuff inbetween the sessions like driving back home and meeting with a friend. I think i have a solid version down but what is is annoying me is that im erroring when i am trying to use the provided test and example file. I searched for an answer online and it seems like i have to modify the test and example file?? its weird and i do not think that is apart of the assignment. 

a little embarrassing but when i was working on the prolog homework i was busy trying to figure out prolog so i already had a file called example.pl. that was what is causing my issue

now that its tested and works without errors supposedly i am going to go to input this and go to sleep after testing a bit more.

2:08am
gonna finish up, will add commenting and do more testing tomorrow to get ready for turn in.

The last time i was working on this i was able to complete the first test and i was satisfied. I'll finish testing and then add commenting and i'll be done. Have to figure out how to turn in the git without problems again tho.

Comments finished, just gotta turn it in now.
