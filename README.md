# ParadigmProject_Two
2nd project for paradigms class \ 
Must write in SWI Prolog (gotta learn it too) \ 
I think i have enough time to start it earlier than last time (hopefully)
Professor said brute force is probably recommended, Prolog loves tail call optimization,

I am going to start the project today instead, because i was preparing for the finals that i have to do (unfortunately) \n
However, despite the project lookin a bit hard i hear from the discord server that the project is relatively easier and faster than the previous project
